        <h4 style="margin-top:10px;">How to play the Dream11 Premier League</h4>

        <ul>
          <li class="pdBtm10">The Dream11 Premier League will be played from 12th April, 2020 to April 30th with 8 teams
            vying to become the first-ever DPL champion on the basis of fan’s votes.</li>
          <li class="pdBtm10">Each day the prediction window will open at 12PM, at which point users can cast their
            prediction on which team (out of the teams playing in the match) will win the fans’ choice match and by how
            many votes, which will be accrued as feed reactions on a single post. </li>
          <li class="pdBtm10">After the prediction window of the match elapses, the match will begin at which point
            users would need to go to the Dream11 social feed and cast their vote as a reaction on the match post that
            has been shared by the Dream11 official page. Users shall cast their vote only during the voting period.
            Only votes cast during the match voting period will be considered. </li>
          <li class="pdBtm10">Only users who predict ALL matches in a day correctly and vote on the appropriate match
            posts on the Dream11 social feed will be eligible to win the INR 100 CB. If there is only one match per day,
            then the user only has to predict a single match to be eligible to receive the INR 100 CB, and if there are
            two matches in a day then users need to correctly predict the outcome for BOTH matches (the user needs to
            win both matches of the day) in order to be eligible to win the Rs 100 CB as a daily prize. Additionally,
            the user would need to vote on the match post by the Dream11 page, which would be posted anytime between 3
            and 3:30 pm and will continue until 6:30 pm for the first match of the day, and anytime between 7pm and
            7:30pm until 10:30 for the second match of the day, to be eligible for the INR 100 CB prize. </li>
          <li class="pdBtm10">Along with the daily prizes, there are also weekly and season long prizes which are won
            based on crossing a certain cumulative points threshold. Points can be accrued by users by correctly
            predicting the outcome of a match. Every correct prediction accrues 50 points to the user. </li>
          <li class="pdBtm10">All the details about how to play the Dream11 Premier League are below:</li>

        </ul>

        <h4 style="margin-top:10px;">Step 1: Make your prediction before the match deadline on the DPL match centre
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li class="pdBtm10">We will host matches everyday with a fixed prediction window that starts at 12:00 PM. You
            can tap on the DPL banner on the Dream11 App’s home page and choose the match that you want to make your
            prediction for.</li>
          <li class="pdBtm10">Your prediction will have to include the match winner, as well as how many votes the team
            will win by in the final match voting process. For example, for a Mumbai vs Chennai match, you could predict
            that Mumbai will win by more than 10,000 votes.</li>
          <li class="pdBtm10">For matches that begin anytime between 3 PM and 3:30 PM, the prediction window will close
            at 3:00 PM. Similarly, for matches anytime between 7 PM and 7:30 PM, the prediction window shuts at 7:00 PM.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h4 style="margin-top:10px;">Step 2: Vote for your favorite team by reacting on the Match feed post made by the
          Dream11 page</h4>

        <ul>
          <li class="pdBtm10">Each match will have a voting window on the Dream11 Feed after the prediction window
            deadline. Head to the Dream11 page on the Feed to vote for the team that you think will win a match during
            the match timings. The way that you vote is through reactions on a feed post by the Dream11 page.</li>

            <p class="pdBtm10">Please note our terms and conditions ("<strong>Terms</strong>") in this respect, as they govern your participation in the Promotion:</p>

              <li class="pdBtm10">The Game Changer Award will be awarded to the user with the highest rank in the Dream11 Mega Contest for each Dream11 IPL match starting from September 19th 2020 until November 8th 2020, given that Dream11 receives explicit consent from the Winner(s) to receive Game Changer Award.</li>
              <li class="pdBtm10">Consent will be received from the Winner through the Dream11 team contacting them directly via telephone and sending a congratulatory email. The Winner will have 3 hours after the telephone call to reply to the congratulatory email from Dream11 after which point, they would no longer be eligible to receive the Game Changer Award.</li>
              <li class="pdBtm10">In the case where the user does not accept the award within 3 hours of the telephone call, another user will be selected in place of such user to receive the Game Changer Award instead. In this case, the process for selecting the recipient of the Game Changer Award is as follows. The first rank holder of the Dream11 Mega Contest with the highest prize pool will be considered first.

If the second rank holder also does not wish to receive the reward and does not provide the necessary consent in accordance with the given time frame, the third rank holder of the same Dream11 Mega Contest will be contacted. If all users in the first 3 ranks of the Dream11 Mega Contest do not wish to be contacted or do not provide consent in time, the first 3 ranks of the second largest Dream11 Mega Contest (in terms of prize pool amount) will be contacted next, starting from the first rank onwards.
